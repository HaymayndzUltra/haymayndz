Summary
🚀 Experienced Software Developer / Mentor — Help Me Go From 0 → 1 on My SaaS Project


I’m building a new software product that’s already well-defined conceptually and partially in motion — but I’ve reached the point where I need an experienced builder’s perspective.

I’m using ChatGPT and Claude to handle a lot of the day-to-day execution, but I’m looking for someone who’s been there before — someone who can help me understand what I don’t know I don’t know.

This isn’t a code-heavy role. It’s a guidance + collaboration role — helping me make smart technical decisions, structure things the right way, and move confidently from idea → MVP → production.


Ideal Candidate:
• Has built and shipped their own product or SaaS (solo or small team)
• Comfortable working across the stack (frontend, backend, database, automations)
• Pragmatic and can explain why something should be done a certain way
• Enjoys teaching and mentoring — not just coding
• Experienced with modern tools like Next.js, Node, Supabase, Postgres, and automation platforms (Zapier/n8n)
• Bonus: Familiar with AI/LLM integrations or has guided others through AI-powered builds


What You’ll Do:
• Act as a technical mentor and advisor
• Join live or recorded screen-share sessions as I build
• Help me spot blind spots and design decisions early
• Offer input on architecture, best practices, and scalability
• Be a sounding board for “is this the right approach?”
• Help accelerate my technical learning curve

About Me:

I’m a founder and builder — not a beginner when it comes to startups, but newer to coding. I know what I want to build and am already making progress using AI tools. What I’m looking for is a trusted technical guide to help me avoid rookie mistakes and move faster.

Engagement Details:
• Hourly, flexible schedule (start part-time)
• Remote / async-friendly — I’m based in the U.S.
• Excellent communication is key
• Preference for someone who’s launched their own SaaS or product independently

💡 If you’re the kind of developer who enjoys helping other builders level up — and you know the satisfaction of taking a product from nothing to something — this will be a great fit.
