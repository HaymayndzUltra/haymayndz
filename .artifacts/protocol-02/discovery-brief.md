# Discovery Brief

**Source:** Job Post (JOB-POST.md) + Proposal (PROPOSAL.md)  
**Purpose:** Pre-call summary of business goals, target users, success metrics, constraints, and client tone

---

## Business Goals

**From Job Post (lines 3-9):**
- Build a SaaS product from 0 → 1
- Move confidently from idea → MVP → production
- Avoid rookie mistakes and move faster
- Accelerate technical learning curve

**From Proposal (lines 9-12):**
- Weekly guidance sessions (or async) through MVP → production
- Architectural reviews and "is this the right approach?" validation
- Catch issues early (example: database scaling issue caught in week 2)

**Synthesized Goal:** Transition from AI-assisted development to production-ready SaaS with experienced mentorship to prevent costly mistakes and architectural debt.

---

## Target Users

**Primary User:** The client (founder/builder)
- Profile: Founder with startup experience, newer to coding
- Current state: Making progress using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Needs: Technical mentor to avoid blind spots and architectural mistakes

**End Users (to be discovered):**
- Not explicitly defined in job post
- **@ASK_CLIENT:** Who are the end users of the SaaS product being built?

---

## Success Metrics

**From Job Post:**
- Avoid rookie mistakes (qualitative)
- Move faster (qualitative)
- Accelerate learning curve (qualitative)

**From Proposal:**
- Catch issues early (quantitative example: 3x cost savings by catching database scaling issue in week 2)
- Prevent expensive refactors
- Validate decisions before implementation

**Synthesized Metrics:**
- Early issue detection (prevent 3x+ cost escalations)
- Zero critical architectural refactors
- Decision validation gates passed
- **@ASK_CLIENT:** What are the specific success metrics for the SaaS product itself? (MRR, user adoption, etc.)

---

## Constraints

**From Job Post:**
- Part-time engagement (hours/week undefined)
- Hourly, flexible schedule
- Remote / async-friendly
- U.S. timezone
- Not code-heavy role (guidance + collaboration focus)

**From Proposal:**
- Weekly cap: 15 hours/week = $1,500/week
- Monthly estimate: $6,000 (60 hours)
- Available weekdays 9am-6pm EST or async
- Timeline: ongoing support through MVP → production

**Identified Constraints:**
- Budget: $1,500/week cap (15 hours @ $100/hr)
- Time: Part-time engagement (specific hours TBD)
- Communication: Async or scheduled calls (preference TBD)
- Scope: Guidance-focused, not implementation-heavy
- **@ASK_CLIENT:** What's the expected weekly time commitment? What's the preferred communication cadence?

---

## Client Tone

**From Job Post:**
- Casual, conversational
- Direct and honest about needs
- Appreciates mentorship and teaching mindset
- Values practical, pragmatic approach

**From Proposal:**
- Matches casual tone
- Emphasizes teaching and mentoring
- Focuses on prevention and early detection
- Outcome-oriented (results from Day 1)

**Tone Summary:** Casual, mentorship-focused, pragmatic, outcome-driven. Communication should be direct, educational, and prevention-oriented.

---

## Key Assumptions to Validate

1. **Time Commitment:** Weekly hours expectation (currently "part-time" is vague)
2. **Communication Format:** Scheduled calls vs async vs hybrid
3. **Technical Focus Areas:** Specific areas to prioritize or assess as we go
4. **Product Scope:** What SaaS product is being built (not specified in job post)
5. **Timeline:** When does MVP need to be production-ready?
6. **End Users:** Who will use the SaaS product?
