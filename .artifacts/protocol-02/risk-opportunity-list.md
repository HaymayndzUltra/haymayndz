# Risk & Opportunity Radar

**Purpose:** Initial risk register and upside identification for discovery call preparation

---

## Risk Register

### Risk 1: Scope Creep - Guidance Expanding to Implementation
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Client may request actual code implementation despite "guidance-only" role definition. Weekly cap may be insufficient if scope expands.  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Clarify role boundaries in discovery call
- Define what "guidance" means vs "implementation"
- Set clear expectations about code review vs code writing
- Establish change request process for scope adjustments

**Status:** ASK CLIENT during discovery call  
**Question Reference:** Q-FUNC-001, Q-FUNC-002

---

### Risk 2: Unclear Product Scope
**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Probability:** HIGH  
**Description:** Product definition missing from job post. Cannot provide relevant architectural guidance without understanding the product.  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- First discovery question must be product definition
- Request product brief, wireframes, or existing documentation
- Identify MVP features vs future features
- Map technical decisions to product requirements

**Status:** ASK CLIENT (Critical - first question)  
**Question Reference:** Q-BUS-005

---

### Risk 3: Time Commitment Mismatch
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** "Part-time" is vague. Client may expect more than 15 hours/week but budget may not support it.  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Clarify expected weekly hours in discovery call
- Discuss workload distribution (calls vs async)
- Align expectations with weekly cap structure
- Propose tiered engagement if needed

**Status:** ASK CLIENT  
**Question Reference:** Q-BUS-001

---

### Risk 4: Communication Format Misalignment
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Probability:** LOW  
**Description:** Client may prefer async but mentor offers scheduled calls, or vice versa.  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Discuss communication preferences early
- Establish response time expectations
- Define escalation paths for urgent issues
- Agree on documentation format for async sessions

**Status:** ASK CLIENT  
**Question Reference:** Q-COMM-001

---

### Risk 5: Technical Stack Assumptions
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Probability:** LOW  
**Description:** Job post mentions Next.js, Supabase, Postgres, but actual stack may differ or client may want to change.  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Validate current tech stack in discovery call
- Discuss any planned migrations or changes
- Assess mentor's expertise match with actual stack
- Identify any missing tools or integrations needed

**Status:** ASK CLIENT  
**Question Reference:** Q-TECH-001, Q-TECH-004

---

### Risk 6: Timeline Unrealistic Expectations
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** "MVP → production" timeline may be aggressive. Client may expect faster progress than realistic.  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Discuss realistic timelines for MVP milestones
- Identify critical path dependencies
- Set expectation that architectural decisions take time
- Define MVP scope clearly before timeline discussion

**Status:** ASK CLIENT  
**Question Reference:** Q-TIME-001, Q-TIME-003

---

## Opportunity Register

### Opportunity 1: Long-Term Engagement
**Description:** Client mentions "ongoing support through MVP → production" suggesting potential for long-term relationship.  
**Upside:** Stable, predictable income stream; deep product knowledge over time.  
**Action:** Discuss engagement phases and evolution from MVP to production support.

---

### Opportunity 2: AI Tool Integration Expertise
**Description:** Client already using ChatGPT/Claude. Mentor has AI/LLM integration expertise.  
**Upside:** Unique value proposition; can optimize AI tool usage for development workflow.  
**Action:** Discuss how AI tools are currently used and identify optimization opportunities.

---

### Opportunity 3: Scalability Prevention
**Description:** Proposal mentions catching database scaling issue early. Client values prevention over reactive fixes.  
**Upside:** High-value guidance that prevents costly mistakes; demonstrates ROI clearly.  
**Action:** Discuss early warning systems and architectural review process.

---

### Opportunity 4: Teaching & Mentoring Focus
**Description:** Client explicitly wants learning and acceleration, not just implementation.  
**Upside:** Engaging work; builds client's technical capability over time; reduces dependency.  
**Action:** Establish learning objectives and measure progress over time.

---

### Opportunity 5: Founder Experience Match
**Description:** Client is experienced founder, newer to coding. Mentor has built own SaaS.  
**Upside:** Strong alignment on business priorities; can bridge business and technical thinking.  
**Action:** Leverage business context in technical decisions.
