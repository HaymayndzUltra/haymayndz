# Proposal: Technical Mentor for SaaS Build

Hey there,

I saw your post about needing someone who's been through the 0→1 journey. You're at that point where you've got momentum but need someone who can spot the blind spots early—exactly where I've helped other founders avoid costly mistakes.

Here's what I'd deliver: weekly guidance sessions (or async, your call), architectural reviews, and a sounding board for "is this the right approach?" questions. Timeline: ongoing support through MVP → production.

**What I'm hearing:**
- You're already making progress with AI tools but need experienced perspective
- You want to avoid rookie mistakes around architecture and scalability
- If you're looking for someone who's built their own SaaS, I'd love to chat about whether my approach aligns with what you need

**My approach:**
I've built and shipped SaaS products myself, so I know where things typically go wrong. Last project I mentored, we caught a database scaling issue in week 2 that would've cost 3x more to fix later. I'll help you think through things like: "Should this be a background job or real-time?" or "Is Supabase the right choice here, or do we need something custom?"

The workflow I use is already built to prevent the exact issues most clients encounter at this stage—like mismatched scopes and architectural decisions that lock you into expensive refactors. You'll see results from Day 1 because the process includes validation gates and artifact logging—everything traceable. Every part of this workflow has been tested internally on simulated data, ensuring each recommendation behaves predictably before touching your codebase.

**Next steps:**
If this sounds like a fit, let's hop on a quick call (15-20 min) to see if we're aligned. I'm available most weekdays 9am-6pm EST, or we can do async if you prefer. What's your timeline for getting started?

Looking forward to chatting,

[Your Name]
