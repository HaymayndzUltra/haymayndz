## 11. REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Meta-level protocol analysis and reasoning patterns documentation -->

### Reasoning Patterns

#### Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution
- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint
- Ensure each step builds on validated outputs from previous steps
- Pattern ensures completeness and traceability

#### Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation
- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff
- Validate both content and structure of deliverables
- Pattern prevents propagation of errors to dependent protocols

#### Pattern Improvement Strategy:
- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback
- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities
- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions

### Decision Logic

#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness
**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution

**Decision Criteria:**
- All prerequisite artifacts present → Proceed
- Required approvals obtained → Proceed
- System state validated → Proceed
- Any prerequisite missing → Halt

**Outcomes:**
- **Proceed:** Execute protocol workflow starting with Phase 1
- **Halt:** Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders, await resolution

**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log

### Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?
2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```
4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution
5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution

### Learning Mechanisms

#### Feedback Loops
**Purpose:** Establish continuous feedback collection to inform protocol improvements.

**Feedback Loop 1: Execution Outcomes**
- **Collection:** Capture outcome data after each protocol execution
- **Analysis:** Identify patterns in successful vs. failed executions

- **Closure:** Validate improvements in next executions

**Feedback Loop 2: Quality Gate Performance**
- **Collection:** Track gate pass/fail patterns in historical logs
- **Analysis:** Identify consistently failing gates or criteria
- **Action:** Adjust gate thresholds or improve upstream deliverables
- **Closure:** Monitor adjusted gates for improved pass rates

**Feedback Loop 3: Downstream Protocol Feedback**
- **Collection:** Capture issues reported by Protocol 04 and 06
- **Analysis:** Identify gaps in brief content or structure

- **Anomaly detection:** Alert on unexpected patterns or deviations

#### Self-Correction Protocols
**Purpose:** Enable autonomous detection and correction of execution issues.

- **Halt condition detection:** Recognize blockers and escalate appropriately
- **Quality gate failure handling:** Generate corrective action plans
- **Anomaly response:** Diagnose and propose fixes for unexpected conditions
- **Recovery procedures:** Maintain execution state for graceful resume

#### Continuous Improvement Integration
**Purpose:** Systematically capture lessons and evolve protocol effectiveness.

- **Retrospective execution:** Conduct after-action reviews post-completion
- **Template review cadence:** Scheduled protocol enhancement cycles
- **Gate calibration:** Periodic adjustment of pass criteria
- **Tool evaluation:** Assessment of automation effectiveness
