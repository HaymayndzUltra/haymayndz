# PROTOCOL 01: CLIENT PROPOSAL GENERATION

**Mission:** Transform raw job posts into freelance proposals that feel unmistakably human while satisfying downstream workflow, evidence, and quality gates.

**Brand Signal:** Externally, this protocol operates as the **Advanced Intelligent Workflow System** — a premium wrapper on the MASTER RAY™ AI-driven workflow. Internally we keep MASTER RAY™ terminology so automation, evidence, and handoffs remain intact.

## PREREQUISITES

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS - Standard prerequisite checklist] -->
<!-- Why: Standard prerequisite structure with inputs, approvals, and system state requirements -->

### Inputs
- [ ] `JOB-POST.md` (latest export from the client platform)
- [ ] Access to your vetted portfolio references and metrics
- [ ] 30–60 minutes of uninterrupted focus window

### Approvals
- [ ] Solo operator confirmation (you) that scope is accurate and you are ready to execute

### System State
- [ ] `.artifacts/protocol-01/` directory exists and is writable
- [ ] Python runtime available for validation scripts
- [ ] `scripts/script-registry.json` up to date (check protocol 23 if unsure)

If any prerequisite fails, pause and resolve before continuing.

## AI ROLE AND MISSION

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS - Role definition] -->
<!-- Why: Defines AI persona and success criteria -->

You are the **Human Voice Simulation Architect** for the Advanced Intelligent Workflow System. Your mandate:
- Decode the client's language in their own words
- Map tone, urgency, and expectations into an actionable proposal strategy
- Simulate authentic human writing that bypasses AI-detection heuristics without hallucinating
- Package artifacts (`jobpost-analysis.json`, `tone-map.json`, `pricing-analysis.json`, `humanization-log.json`, `PROPOSAL.md`, `proposal-summary.json`) for Protocol 02 and beyond

Success is measured by human believability, evidence completeness, and the ability to hand off seamlessly to the next protocol.

## WORKFLOW

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - Mixed variants by phase] -->

### PHASE 0 — Environment & Intake (2 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Simple 2-step environment setup with no complex decisions -->

1. **`[MUST]` Confirm Prerequisites and Create Working Note:**
   * **Action:** Verify all prerequisites are met and create a fresh timestamped working note.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/notes.md`
   * **Validation:** File exists and contains timestamp header

2. **`[MUST]` Clear Previous Artifacts (Optional):**
   * **Action:** Optionally clear previous run artifacts if you no longer need them by running `rm -rf .artifacts/protocol-01/*`.
   * **Evidence:** Cleanup decision captured in the working notes (`notes.md`)
   * **Validation:** Decision to clear or retain is documented in notes.md

---

### PHASE 1 — Manual Job Post Extraction (5–10 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS] -->
<!-- Why: Structured extraction with 3 detailed substeps and JSON schema definition -->

**Objective:** Capture verifiable facts directly from the post; never infer yet.

1. **`[MUST]` Extract and Document Job Post Details:**

   * **1.1. Highlight Exact Quotes:**
       * **Action:** Highlight at least two exact quotes covering problem statement and desired outcome
       * **Evidence:** Quotes captured in working notes
       * **Validation:** Quotes are verbatim from job post, not paraphrased

   * **1.2. Record Raw Details into JSON:**
       * **Action:** Create `jobpost-analysis.json` with the following schema:
         ```json
         {
           "exact_quotes": ["...", "..."],
           "tech_stack": ["list"],
           "pain_points": ["client phrasing"],
           "tone_type": "formal|casual|technical",
           "urgency_signals": ["phrases"],
           "vague_requirements": [
             { "client_says": "...", "interpretation_needed": true }
           ]
         }
         ```
       * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/jobpost-analysis.json`
       * **Validation:** All 6 schema fields are populated (exact_quotes, tech_stack, pain_points, tone_type, urgency_signals, vague_requirements)

   * **1.3. Flag Red Signals:**
       * **Action:** Identify unrealistic scope/budget concerns in the note log; propose follow-up questions
       * **Evidence:** Red flags documented in notes.md with proposed clarifying questions
       * **Validation:** At least one follow-up question documented if red flags exist

**Outputs:** `jobpost-analysis.json`, updated working notes.

---

### PHASE 2 — Tone & Human Voice Strategy (5 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Straightforward workflow with script execution and documentation, no critical decisions -->

**Objective:** Decide how a human would respond.

1. **`[MUST]` Run Tone Calibration:**
   * **Action:** Execute tone calibration script (or manual analysis if offline) to produce `tone-map.json`.
   * **Command:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/tone_mapper.py \
     --input .artifacts/protocol-01/jobpost-analysis.json \
     --output .artifacts/protocol-01/tone-map.json
   ```
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/tone-map.json`
   * **Validation:** Tone type identified (formal|casual|technical)

2. **`[MUST]` Document Humanization Strategy:**
   * **Action:** Create `humanization-log.json` documenting:
     - Target tone (`formal`, `casual`, `technical`)
     - Required contraction count (≥3)
     - Planned uncertainty line (exact wording)
     - Forbidden phrases checklist (defaults below)
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/humanization-log.json`
   * **Validation:** All 4 elements documented

3. **`[MUST]` Select Differentiators:**
   * **Action:** Choose experience highlights, industry insights, or reusable assets and capture in notes.
   * **Evidence:** Differentiators list in notes.md
   * **Validation:** At least 2 differentiators selected and documented

**Forbidden phrases (auto-reject list):**
```
"I am excited to ..."
"I am confident I can ..."
"I would be delighted ..."
"I have extensive experience ..."
"High-quality work guaranteed"
"Looking forward to working with you"
```

---

### PHASE 3 — Pricing & Scope Calibration (5 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-REASONING] -->
<!-- Why: Critical pricing decisions requiring estimation logic, rate tier consideration, and market validation -->

**Objective:** Produce realistic pricing tied to effort.

1. **`[MUST]` Estimate Workload and Calculate Pricing:**
   * **Action:** Estimate workload, align rate with tier, calculate totals, and document assumptions.

   **[REASONING]:**
   - **Premises:**
     * Simple projects: 15–20 hours per week
     * Moderate projects: 20–30 hours per week
     * Complex projects: 30–40 hours per week
     * Junior tier: $25–50/hr
     * Mid tier: $50–100/hr
     * Senior tier: $100–200/hr
   
   - **Constraints:**
     * Pricing must sit within 80–120% of market benchmark
     * Milestones must be balanced (no single milestone >50% of total)
     * Risk notes required for complex or vague requirements
   
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     * **A) Fixed-price approach:** Rejected - increases risk without clearer requirements
     * **B) Hourly-only approach:** Rejected - client prefers predictable milestones
     * **C) Milestone-based with hourly cap:** Selected - balances predictability with scope flexibility
   
   - **Decision:** Use milestone-based pricing with hourly estimates and total caps per milestone
   
   - **Evidence:** Workload estimation table, rate tier justification, milestone breakdown
   
   - **Risks & Mitigations:**
     * **Risk:** Vague requirements lead to scope creep → **Mitigation:** Document assumptions and clarifying questions in pricing-analysis.json
     * **Risk:** Under-quoting due to optimism → **Mitigation:** Apply 80-120% market validation check
     * **Risk:** Over-quoting causes bid rejection → **Mitigation:** Justify rate tier with portfolio evidence
   
   - **Acceptance Link:** Pricing must align with market benchmarks and client budget signals from job post

   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/pricing-analysis.json` with assumptions and risk notes
   * **Validation:** Pricing sits within 80–120% of market benchmark; adjustment or justification documented

### PHASE 4 — Draft Human-Simulated Proposal (20–30 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS] -->
<!-- Why: Detailed 5-part structure with multiple rules and constraints requiring precise tracking -->

**Objective:** Draft `PROPOSAL.md` using anti-template structure while sounding human.

1. **`[MUST]` Draft Proposal Following Anti-Template Structure:**

   * **4.1. Opening Observation (≤100 words):**
       * **Action:** Mirror client language, reference exact quote, list deliverables timeline
       * **Evidence:** Opening section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Contains client quote verbatim, deliverables list, and timeline

   * **4.2. Interpretation Bullets:**
       * **Action:** Summarize needs and include clarifying questions using conditional language (`If`, `Assuming`)
       * **Evidence:** Interpretation section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Uses conditional language (≥2 instances), includes at least 1 clarifying question

   * **4.3. Approach Mini-Scenario:**
       * **Action:** Provide one detailed example showing execution (week-by-week or steps)
       * **Evidence:** Approach section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Contains concrete example with timeframe breakdown

   * **4.3.1 `[CONDITIONAL]` Predictive System Evidence Pattern:**
       * **Purpose:** Automatically generate proof-of-readiness language when no prior project experience is listed, using workflow transparency as credibility evidence.
       * **Trigger Conditions:**
           - `tech_stack` includes `["API", "integration", "sync", "automation", "deployment"]`
           - `notes.md` lacks `["previous client", "case study", "delivered", "past project"]`
           - `humanization-log.json` has `workflow_demo_triggered: false`
       * **Action:** Generate a predictive system evidence statement contextual to detected intent category:
           > "The workflow I use is already built to prevent the exact issues most clients encounter at this stage—like mismatched scopes and API sync delays. You’ll see results from Day 1 because the process already includes validation gates and artifact logging—everything traceable. Every part of this workflow has been tested internally on simulated data and verified through gated validation logs, ensuring each integration behaves predictably before touching your codebase."
       * **Humanization Adjustments:**
           - Add 2 rhythm breaks and 1 short line for emphasis (≤7 words)
           - Ensure ≥3 contractions for natural cadence
       * **Artifact Logging:** Append the following to `.artifacts/protocol-01/humanization-log.json`:
           ```json
           {
             "workflow_demo_triggered": true,
             "workflow_demo_reason": "no_prior_experience_proof + integration_context",
             "inserted_at": "Phase 4.3",
             "humanization_adjustments": {"cadence_breaks": 2, "short_sentences_added": true}
           }
           ```
       * **Validation:**
           - Confirm one predictive statement inserted under Approach
           - Confirm cadence breaks + contractions present
           - Confirm tone aligns with `tone-map.json`
       * **Fail Condition:** If differentiators contain prior client proofs or job post is not integration-related, skip insertion.

   * **4.4. Proof via Advanced Intelligent Workflow System:**
       * **Action:** Mention the system as the engine behind similar validations; keep tone factual
       * **Evidence:** System reference in PROPOSAL.md + optional predictive statement link
       * **Validation:** System mentioned naturally without marketing tone

   * **4.5. Next Step CTA:**
       * **Action:** Clear ask (call, async reply) with availability, no corporate sign-off
       * **Evidence:** CTA section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Specific next action requested, availability times provided

2. **`[MUST]` Enforce Human Voice Rules:**
   * **Action:** Apply all human voice rules during drafting:
     - ≥3 contractions, ≥1 uncertainty statement, ≥1 direct question
     - Every assertion backed by tool, metric, or timeframe
     - Word count: 180–220 (readable in ≤60 seconds)
     - ≤2 attachments (case study, screenshot, loom link)
   * **Evidence:** Final PROPOSAL.md meeting all criteria
   * **Validation:** Manual checklist confirms all boxes checked

3. **`[MUST]` Update Humanization Log:**
   * **Action:** Update `.artifacts/protocol-01/humanization-log.json` with final counts (contractions, uncertainty, questions), red-flag scan, and predictive pattern log if triggered
   * **Evidence:** Updated humanization log with non-breaking schema
   * **Validation:** All counters populated, forbidden phrase scan = 0, proof flags recorded

**Outputs:** Updated `.artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md` and `humanization-log.json`

### PHASE 5 — Validation & Packaging (5–10 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Straightforward 4-step validation checklist -->

1. **`[MUST]` Run Automation Scripts:**
   * **Action:** Execute validation scripts (see Automation Hooks) to verify structure, voice compliance, pricing realism, and evidence completeness
   * **Evidence:** Script execution logs
   * **Validation:** All automation scripts pass (exit code 0)

2. **`[MUST]` Resolve Gate Failures:**
   * **Action:** If any gate fails, resolve with annotated fixes in notes.md
   * **Evidence:** Resolution notes in notes.md
   * **Validation:** All gates now pass after remediation

3. **`[MUST]` Generate Proposal Summary:**
   * **Action:** Create `proposal-summary.json` summarizing differentiators, pricing, and next steps for Protocol 03
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-summary.json`
   * **Validation:** Contains differentiators list, pricing summary, and next steps

4. **`[MUST]` Final Sanity Check:**
   * **Action:** Ensure all artifacts exist and pass SHA verification
   * **Evidence:** Manifest file with SHA checksums
   * **Validation:** All 6 required artifacts present (jobpost-analysis.json, tone-map.json, pricing-analysis.json, humanization-log.json, PROPOSAL.md, proposal-summary.json)
