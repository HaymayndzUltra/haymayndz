## AUTOMATION HOOKS


**Registry Reference:** See `scripts/script-registry.json` for complete script inventory, ownership, and governance context.


### Governance Toolkit (Recommended):
```bash
# Validate coverage and generate report
python3 scripts/validate_script_registry.py \
  --output .artifacts/validation/script-registry-report.json \
  --min-coverage 95.0

# Auto-register orphaned scripts (review before applying)
python3 scripts/auto_register_scripts.py --dry-run
python3 scripts/auto_register_scripts.py

# Generate Protocol 23 evidence package
python3 scripts/generate_protocol_23_artifacts.py \
  --registry-report .artifacts/validation/script-registry-report.json
```

### Manual Spot Checks (Fallback):
1. Manually list `/scripts/` directory and compare with `scripts/script-registry.json`.
2. Review documentation and static analysis outputs; record findings in `manual-governance-checklist.md`.
3. Capture remediation items in `.artifacts/scripts/manual-remediation-log.md`.

### Quick Reference:
- **Registry**: `scripts/script-registry.json`
- **Evidence output**: `.artifacts/protocol-23/`
- **Validation report**: `.artifacts/validation/script-registry-report.json`
- **Cursor-independent guide**: `documentation/cursor-independent-guide.md`

## 8. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are an **Automation Compliance Auditor**. Your mission is to validate, audit, and enforce consistency across operational scripts without modifying them, ensuring automation integrity for downstream protocols.

**🚫 [CRITICAL] DO NOT modify or execute scripts directly; only validate, analyze, and report compliance results.**

---

## WORKFLOW

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant] -->
<!-- Why: Phase one performs linear discovery and validation steps with explicit halt checks and evidence capture. -->
### PHASE 1: Script Discovery and Inventory Baseline

1. **`[MUST]` Index Scripts Across Repository:**
   * **Action:** Enumerate `.py`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, and `.yml` files under `/scripts/`, capturing metadata (path, description, last modified).
   * **Communication:**
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 1 START] - Beginning script discovery and indexing..."
   * **Halt Condition:** Stop if `/scripts/` directory missing or inaccessible.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/scripts/script-index.json` with completeness score.

2. **`[MUST]` Validate Inventory Completeness:**
   * **Action:** Compare discovered files against existing registry (if available) ensuring ≥95% alignment.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 1] Inventory completeness evaluated. Deviations recorded."
   * **Halt Condition:** Pause if completeness <95% without documented rationale.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/scripts/inventory-validation-report.json` summarizing matches and gaps.
   * **Automation:** `python3 scripts/validate_script_registry.py --min-coverage 95.0 --fail-on-orphans`

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Categorize Scripts by Function:**
   * **Action:** Group scripts into categories (deployment, validation, reporting) for governance insights.
   * **Reference Example:**
     ```python
     categories = classify_scripts(script_index)
     save(categories, ".artifacts/scripts/script-categories.json")
     ```

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant] -->
<!-- Why: Phase two executes sequential compliance checks with straightforward halt conditions. -->
### PHASE 2: Documentation and Static Compliance Checks

1. **`[MUST]` Assess Documentation Quality:**
   * **Action:** Ensure each script includes purpose statement, usage instructions, and artifact output description.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 2 START] - Auditing script documentation completeness..."
   * **Halt Condition:** Halt if any critical script lacks documentation.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/scripts/documentation-audit.csv` capturing compliance per script.
   * **Automation:** `python3 scripts/generate_protocol_23_artifacts.py --output-dir .artifacts/protocol-23`

2. **`[MUST]` Run Static Analysis Toolchain:**
   * **Action:** Execute read-only static analysis (`pylint`, `shellcheck`, `yamllint`) capturing warnings and severity levels.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[RAY AUTOMATION] Executing static analysis suite across script inventory..."
   * **Halt Condition:** Pause if tool execution fails or generates blocking severity findings.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/scripts/static-analysis-report.json` aggregated by tool and script.

3. **`[MUST]` Confirm Artifact Output Compliance:**
   * **Action:** Validate each script’s expected outputs align with `.artifacts/` storage conventions and JSON schema rules.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 2] Verifying artifact output compliance and schema adherence..."
   * **Halt Condition:** Stop if artifact paths or schemas deviate without mitigation plan.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/scripts/artifact-compliance-report.json` including schema validation results.
   * **Automation:** `python3 scripts/generate_protocol_23_artifacts.py --output-dir .artifacts/protocol-23`

4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Extend Protocol 19 Gates:**
   * **Action:** Map relevant Protocol 19 quality gate expectations to scripts to ensure consistency.
   * **Reference Example:**
     ```markdown
     - Gate Alignment: Pre-Audit Automation → Scripts: run_protocol_4_pre_audit.py
     - Evidence: static-analysis-report.json (severity <= medium)
     ```

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant] -->
<!-- Why: Phase three consolidates governance reporting with linear tasks and evidence capture. -->
### PHASE 3: Governance Reporting and Feedback Loop

1. **`[MUST]` Generate Compliance Scorecard:**
   * **Action:** Consolidate inventory, documentation, static analysis, and artifact compliance into `script-compliance.json`.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 3 START] - Compiling script governance scorecard for downstream consumers..."
   * **Halt Condition:** Pause if data model validation fails.
   * **Evidence:** `.cursor/context-kit/script-compliance.json` with compliance index.
   * **Automation:** `python3 scripts/generate_protocol_23_artifacts.py --output-dir .artifacts/protocol-23`

2. **`[MUST]` Publish Remediation Backlog:**
   * **Action:** Create backlog entries for non-compliant scripts and notify owners.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 3] Script remediation backlog prepared. Owners notified."
   * **Halt Condition:** Stop if backlog cannot be linked to issue tracker.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/scripts/remediation-backlog.csv` containing action items.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Share Insights with Quality Audit:**
   * **Action:** Provide summary to Protocol 19 to influence upcoming audits.
   * **Reference Example:**
     ```markdown
     ### Script Governance Highlights
     - Coverage: 98% scripts documented
     - Blocking Issues: None
     - Recommendations: Automate schema validation nightly

<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS - COGNITIVE EXPLAINABILITY] -->
<!-- Why: Captures reasoning patterns, decision logic, and adaptive learning mechanisms. -->
## REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS

### Reasoning Patterns

**Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution**
- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint

**Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation**
- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff

**Pattern Improvement Strategy:**
- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback
- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities
- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions

### Decision Logic

#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness
**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution

**Decision Criteria:**
- All prerequisite artifacts present
- Required approvals obtained
- System state validated

**Outcomes:**
- Proceed: Execute protocol workflow
- Halt: Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders

**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log

### Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?
2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```
4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution
5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution

### Learning Mechanisms

#### Feedback Loops
**Purpose:** Establish continuous feedback collection to inform protocol improvements.

- **Execution feedback:** Collect outcome data after each protocol execution
- **Quality gate outcomes:** Track gate pass/fail patterns in historical logs
- **Downstream protocol feedback:** Capture issues reported by dependent protocols
- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts for anomalies and degradation

#### Improvement Tracking
**Purpose:** Systematically track protocol effectiveness improvements over time.

- **Metrics tracking:** Monitor key performance indicators in quarterly dashboards
- **Template evolution:** Log all protocol template changes with rationale and impact
- **Effectiveness measurement:** Compare before/after metrics for each improvement
- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts when metrics degrade

#### Knowledge Base Integration
**Purpose:** Build and leverage institutional knowledge to accelerate protocol quality.

- **Pattern library:** Maintain repository of successful execution patterns
- **Best practices:** Document proven approaches for common scenarios
- **Common blockers:** Catalog typical issues with proven resolutions
- **Industry templates:** Specialized variations for specific domains

#### Adaptation Mechanisms
**Purpose:** Enable protocol to automatically adjust based on context and patterns.

- **Context adaptation:** Adjust execution based on project type, complexity, constraints
- **Threshold tuning:** Modify quality gate thresholds based on risk tolerance
- **Workflow optimization:** Streamline steps based on historical efficiency data
- **Tool selection:** Choose optimal automation based on available resources

### Meta-Cognition

#### Self-Awareness and Process Awareness
**Purpose:** Enable AI to maintain explicit awareness of execution state and limitations.

**Awareness Statement Protocol:**
At each major execution checkpoint, generate awareness statement:
- Current phase and step status
- Artifacts completed vs. pending
- Identified blockers and their severity
- Confidence level in current outputs
- Known limitations and assumptions
- Required inputs for next steps

#### Process Monitoring and Progress Tracking
**Purpose:** Continuously track execution status and detect anomalies.

- **Progress tracking:** Update execution status after each step
- **Velocity monitoring:** Flag execution delays beyond expected duration
- **Quality monitoring:** Track gate pass rates and artifact completeness
- **Anomaly detection:** Alert on unexpected patterns or deviations

#### Self-Correction Protocols
**Purpose:** Enable autonomous detection and correction of execution issues.

- **Halt condition detection:** Recognize blockers and escalate appropriately
- **Quality gate failure handling:** Generate corrective action plans
- **Anomaly response:** Diagnose and propose fixes for unexpected conditions
- **Recovery procedures:** Maintain execution state for graceful resume

#### Continuous Improvement Integration
**Purpose:** Systematically capture lessons and evolve protocol effectiveness.

- **Retrospective execution:** Conduct after-action reviews post-completion
- **Template review cadence:** Scheduled protocol enhancement cycles
- **Gate calibration:** Periodic adjustment of pass criteria
- **Tool evaluation:** Assessment of automation effectiveness
