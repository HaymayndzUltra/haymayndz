# PROTOCOL 14 : PRE-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION & STAGING READINESS (RELEASE COMPLIANT)

**Purpose:** Execute Unknown Protocol workflow with quality validation and evidence generation.

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS - Requirements & Standards] -->
## 1. PREREQUISITES

**[STRICT]** List all required artifacts, approvals, and system states before execution.

### 1.1 Required Artifacts
**[MUST]** Validate presence of upstream artifacts before protocol initiation:

- **`[REQUIRED]`** `QUALITY-AUDIT-PACKAGE.zip` from Protocol 12 – audit readiness evidence
- **`[REQUIRED]`** `integration-evidence-bundle.zip` from Protocol 11 – integration validation summary
- **`[REQUIRED]`** `UAT-CLOSURE-PACKAGE.zip` from Protocol 13 – stakeholder acceptance proof
- **`[REQUIRED]`** `.artifacts/pre-deployment/release-manifest.json` (initial draft) from Release Planning
- **`[REQUIRED]`** Latest deployment scripts (`scripts/deploy_*.sh`, `scripts/rollback_*.sh`) from repository

### 1.2 Required Approvals
**[MUST]** Obtain necessary authorizations:

- **`[REQUIRED]`** Quality Audit readiness recommendation signed by Senior Quality Engineer (Protocol 12)
- **`[REQUIRED]`** Product Owner confirmation that release scope is fixed (Protocol 06)
- **`[REQUIRED]`** Security and compliance lead clearance for staging deployment rehearsals

### 1.3 System State Requirements
**[MUST]** Verify system readiness:

- **`[REQUIRED]`** Access to deployment automation credentials and secret stores for staging
- **`[REQUIRED]`** Monitoring dashboards accessible for baseline capture

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS - Role Definition] -->
## 2. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are a **Release Engineer**. Your mission is to transform integration-approved increments into a production-ready release candidate by validating staging parity, rehearsing deployment mechanics, and documenting rollback readiness.

**🚫 [CRITICAL]** DO NOT issue a production go/no-go package unless staging mirrors production configurations and both deployment and rollback procedures have been executed successfully with captured evidence.

## 11. REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS

### 11.1 Reasoning Patterns

**Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution**
- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint

**Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation**
- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff

**Pattern Improvement Strategy:**
- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback
- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities
- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions

### 11.2 Decision Logic

#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness
**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution

**Decision Criteria:**
- All prerequisite artifacts present
- Required approvals obtained
- System state validated

**Outcomes:**
- Proceed: Execute protocol workflow
- Halt: Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders

**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log

### 11.3 Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?
2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```
4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution
5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution

### 11.4 Learning Mechanisms

#### Feedback Loops
**Purpose:** Establish continuous feedback collection to inform protocol improvements.

- **Execution feedback:** Collect outcome data after each protocol execution
- **Quality gate outcomes:** Track gate pass/fail patterns in historical logs
- **Downstream protocol feedback:** Capture issues reported by dependent protocols
- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts for anomalies and degradation

#### Improvement Tracking
**Purpose:** Systematically track protocol effectiveness improvements over time.

- **Metrics tracking:** Monitor key performance indicators in quarterly dashboards
- **Template evolution:** Log all protocol template changes with rationale and impact
- **Effectiveness measurement:** Compare before/after metrics for each improvement
- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts when metrics degrade

#### Knowledge Base Integration
**Purpose:** Build and leverage institutional knowledge to accelerate protocol quality.

- **Pattern library:** Maintain repository of successful execution patterns
- **Best practices:** Document proven approaches for common scenarios
- **Common blockers:** Catalog typical issues with proven resolutions
- **Industry templates:** Specialized variations for specific domains

#### Adaptation Mechanisms
**Purpose:** Enable protocol to automatically adjust based on context and patterns.

- **Context adaptation:** Adjust execution based on project type, complexity, constraints
- **Threshold tuning:** Modify quality gate thresholds based on risk tolerance
- **Workflow optimization:** Streamline steps based on historical efficiency data
- **Tool selection:** Choose optimal automation based on available resources

### 11.5 Meta-Cognition

#### Self-Awareness and Process Awareness
**Purpose:** Enable AI to maintain explicit awareness of execution state and limitations.

**Awareness Statement Protocol:**
At each major execution checkpoint, generate awareness statement:
- Current phase and step status
- Artifacts completed vs. pending
- Identified blockers and their severity
- Confidence level in current outputs
- Known limitations and assumptions
- Required inputs for next steps

#### Process Monitoring and Progress Tracking
**Purpose:** Continuously track execution status and detect anomalies.

- **Progress tracking:** Update execution status after each step
- **Velocity monitoring:** Flag execution delays beyond expected duration
- **Quality monitoring:** Track gate pass rates and artifact completeness
- **Anomaly detection:** Alert on unexpected patterns or deviations

#### Self-Correction Protocols
**Purpose:** Enable autonomous detection and correction of execution issues.

- **Halt condition detection:** Recognize blockers and escalate appropriately
- **Quality gate failure handling:** Generate corrective action plans
- **Anomaly response:** Diagnose and propose fixes for unexpected conditions
- **Recovery procedures:** Maintain execution state for graceful resume

#### Continuous Improvement Integration
**Purpose:** Systematically capture lessons and evolve protocol effectiveness.

- **Retrospective execution:** Conduct after-action reviews post-completion
- **Template review cadence:** Scheduled protocol enhancement cycles
- **Gate calibration:** Periodic adjustment of pass criteria
- **Tool evaluation:** Assessment of automation effectiveness
